- Fetching news from various sources
- Providing weather updates
- Answering predefined queries
- Learning new responses
### pacages to install
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install requests
pip install textblob
pip install nltk

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-chatbot.git
    cd voice-chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the required NLTK resources:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')


## input through voice example:/news_business news: etc
You said: planets what are called planet
## output 
Bot: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.


    ```

### Usage

1. Run the chatbot:
    ```sh
    python lib/chatbot_api.py

    ##to stop
    crtl+c => to stop

    ```

2. Interact with the chatbot using your voice. The chatbot will respond to your queries and provide information such as news and weather updates.

### Configuration

- **Weather API Key**: Set your OpenWeatherMap API key as an environment variable:
    ```sh
    export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

- **News API Key**: Set your NewsAPI key as an environment variable:
    ```sh
    export NEWSAPI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

# chartbot

## A new Flutter project integrated with a Python-based Voice Chatbot.

## Description

## Chartbot: A Voice-Enabled Chatbot with Flutter and Python Integration

Chartbot is a sophisticated voice-enabled chatbot designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. This project leverages the strengths of both Flutter for its cross-platform front-end development capabilities and Python for its robust back-end processing and machine learning capabilities.  Chartbot aims to go beyond simple text-based interactions, offering users a natural and intuitive way to communicate through voice.

## Core Features and Functionality:

Voice Recognition: Chartbot utilizes advanced speech recognition libraries (e.g., SpeechRecognition, Vosk) in Python to accurately transcribe spoken language into text. This allows users to interact with the chatbot hands-free, making it convenient for various situations.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): The chatbot employs text-to-speech engines (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS) to convert its responses into audible speech. This enables a dynamic and engaging conversation, making the interaction feel more natural and human-like.
Information Retrieval: Chartbot is equipped to fetch real-time information, including:
News Updates: By integrating with news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Google News API), Chartbot can provide users with the latest headlines and news summaries on various topics.
Weather Updates: Integration with weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) allows Chartbot to deliver current weather conditions, forecasts, and related information for specified locations.
Dynamic Response Generation: Beyond pre-programmed responses, Chartbot can dynamically generate replies based on user input. This may involve:
Rule-based systems: For simpler interactions, the chatbot can use predefined rules to match user queries with appropriate responses.
Machine Learning Models: For more complex conversations, Chartbot can integrate with machine learning models (e.g., trained on large datasets of conversational data) to generate more contextually relevant and nuanced responses. This could include using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Adaptive Learning: A key feature of Chartbot is its ability to learn from user interactions. By storing and analyzing conversations, the chatbot can identify patterns and improve its response accuracy over time. This can be achieved through:
Reinforcement Learning: The chatbot can learn through a reward system, where positive user feedback reinforces desired responses.
Supervised Learning: User-provided corrections or feedback can be used to retrain the underlying models, leading to continuous improvement in the chatbot's performance.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: The Flutter framework enables Chartbot to be deployed on multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, from a single codebase, reducing development time and effort.
Seamless Integration: The project effectively integrates the Flutter front-end with the Python back-end. This can be achieved using various communication methods, such as:
REST APIs: The Python back-end can expose RESTful APIs that the Flutter front-end can call to send user input and receive chatbot responses.
gRPC: For more efficient communication, gRPC can be used.
User Interface (UI) Design: The Flutter UI can be designed to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. This may include:
Voice input visualization: Displaying waveforms or other visual cues during voice input.
Conversation history: Displaying the conversation history in a clear and organized manner.
Settings and customization: Allowing users to customize the chatbot's behavior or appearance.
Technical Architecture:

## The project typically follows a client-server architecture:

Client (Flutter App): The Flutter app running on the user's device handles voice input, displays the chatbot's responses, and manages the user interface.
Server (Python Back-end): The Python back-end processes the voice input (speech recognition), generates responses (using rules or machine learning models), fetches information (news, weather), and handles the adaptive learning process. It communicates with the Flutter app through APIs.
Technologies Used:
## Approach 1
## Front-end: Flutter
## Back-end: Python
## Approach 2
## direct voice bot using python
Speech Recognition: SpeechRecognition, Vosk, other suitable libraries
Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3, gTTS, other suitable libraries
News API: NewsAPI, Google News API, other suitable APIs
Weather API: OpenWeatherMap, other suitable APIs
Machine Learning Libraries (Optional): TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
API Framework (Optional): Flask, Django REST Framework, gRPC
Chartbot represents a significant step towards more intuitive and accessible human-computer interaction.  By combining the power of voice with intelligent back-end processing, it provides a rich and engaging user experience.
